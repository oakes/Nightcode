## Introduction

Nightcode is a simple IDE for Clojure and ClojureScript. Do `boot run` for development and `boot build` to make a jar file.

## Working With Source

Nichtcode can be built and run with [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/), [git](http://git-scm.com/), and the [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)(version 6 or higher) on your path.

the following commands can be used to build and run Nightcode

    $ git clone https://github.com/oakes/Nightcode.git
    $ cd Nightcode
    $ lein run (this may take a while to compile)

and when you want to get the latest source from the repository:

    $ git pull
