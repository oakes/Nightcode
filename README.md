This is my fork of Nightcode to use these dependencies:
lein-droid 0.2.0-preview4
neko 3.0.0-preview4

## Introduction

Nightcode is a simple IDE for Clojure and Java. It integrates a copy of Leiningen as well as the lein-cljsbuild, lein-droid, and lein-fruit plugins. The goal is to provide a simple, all-in-one solution to get started with Clojure/Java programming for the command line, the desktop, the web, Android, and iOS. Please see [the website](https://nightcode.info) for more details.

## Licensing

All source files that originate from this project are dedicated to the public domain. That particularly includes the files in `src/clojure/nightcode`. All third-party code in this project remains under their original licenses. I would love pull requests, and will assume that they are also dedicated to the public domain.
